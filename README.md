Cluster 1:
  4. Each product must have a unit and a price per unit, denominated in Euros
  5. Customers place orders over the phone, providing their unique seven-digit customer number with a two-digit area code and one-digit checksum
  6. Authenticate customers over the phone and check for blacklisting.
  10. Provide an eight-digit order number with a checksum at the end of the order process
  16. Enable customers to inquire about the status of their order using the order number
  17. Allow order cancellation by phone before the order is assembled. Cancellations are irreversible, and order updates require placing a new order
  19. Enable ordering and canceling via SMS, using specific formats for product codes and order numbers

Cluster 2:
  11. Packing clerks assemble orders and place them in a paper bag
  12. Print labels and invoices with specific details, including the names of the customer and packing clerk, address, order number, and assigned delivery clerk
  14. Delivery clerks to calculate the best delivery route, often with the aid of a spreadsheet
  18. Automate current processes with a web application, supporting specific browser versions for customers, packing clerks, delivery clerks, and managers
  22. Automate the transfer of expected payment records to the existing payment system once an order is assembled
  23. Generate automatic daily business reports for managers, detailing orders, products, amounts, clerks involved, customers, addresses, and order numbers

Cluster 3:
  1. Guarantee breakfast delivery in under 25 minutes across the city
  2. Offer various prepackaged breakfast options and allow customers to assemble individual breakfasts from a list of products
  3. Support the inclusion of both simple and prepackaged products within orders
  7. Allow customers to directly name products, choose from a recommended list, or use a previous order as a blueprint to assemble their shopping cart

Cluster 4:
  15. Require customers to sign an invoice copy to confirm delivery
  20. Replace signature-based delivery confirmation with a browser-based system where customers enter a password to confirm delivery
  21. Implement a product search function accessible via a browser without the need for authentication

Cluster 5:
  8. Restrict to one blueprint order per new order, though a single order can be used as a blueprint multiple times
  9. Associate only one delivery address per customer, eliminating the need to specify it for each order
  13. Allow for multiple prints of an invoice, each with a unique copy number
```
